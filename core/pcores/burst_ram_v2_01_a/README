OVERVIEW
========

The burst_ram core is used for transferring larger chunks of data between
system memory and a hardware thread in a ReconOS system. It can also be used
as local storage for hardware threads.

The core is quite parametrizable. By varying the port address width, an
appropriate amount of BRAM primitives will be instantiated and connected to
form an RAM area between 4 and 64 kBytes. Port A is connected to the hardware
thread and has a fixed data width of 32 bits. Port B connects to the OS
interface and is capable of 64 bit transfers, which is the usual width of
the system's PLB.

NOTE: MORE THAN ONE PORT IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!

On the thread side (PORTA), it is possible to have two ports (PORTA and PORTAX),
each accessing one half of the total block RAM:

              ---------
             |         |
   PORTA ----|         |-\
   (32 bit)  |         |  \
              ---------    \   
                            |---- PORTB
              ---------    /      (64 bit)
             |         |  /
   PORTAX ---|         |-/
   (32 bit)  |         |
              ---------

The OSIF side (PORTB) still sees the RAM as one block of contiguos memory.

If configured for just one thread-side port (G_PORTA_PORTS = 1), the *ax signals
(clkax, weax, doutax...) will not be used and should be connected to '0'
or left open.

The generics to parametrize the RAM are checked for consistency. Allowed
combinations of the generics are as follows:

 G_PORTA_DWIDTH = 32  (fixed)
 G_PORTB_DWIDTH = 64  (fixed)

  G_PORTA_PORTS | G_PORTA_AWIDTH | G_PORTB_AWIDTH | size
 ---------------+----------------+----------------+-----
       1        |       10       |       9        |  4kB
       1        |       11       |      10        |  8kB
*      1        |       12       |      11        | 16kB
*      1        |       13       |      12        | 32kB
*      1        |       14       |      13        | 64kB
       2        |       10       |      10        |  8kB (2x4kB)
       2        |       11       |      11        | 16kB (2x8kB)
*      2        |       12       |      12        | 32kB (2x16kB)
*      2        |       13       |      13        | 64kB (2x32kB)

 G_PORTB_USE_BE : Use byte enables on port B. Only possible if enough BRAMs 
                  are used so that each BRAM has a width of less or equal
                  than 8 on port B. These cases are highlighted with an
                  asterisk in the table above.



USAGE
=====

Use burst_ram as a drop-in replacement for the old coregen-generated burst RAM
core in the hw_task.vhd file of ReconOS hardware threads. You need to include a
component declaration and set the generics in the instantiation appropriately.
The byte enable signals for port B are only used if G_PORTB_USE_BE is set to 1.

E.g.:

	burst_ram_i : burst_ram
		generic map (
			G_PORTA_AWIDTH => C_TASK_BURST_AWIDTH,
			G_PORTA_DWIDTH => C_TASK_BURST_DWIDTH,
			G_PORTA_PORTS  => 1,
			G_PORTB_AWIDTH => C_BUS_BURST_AWIDTH-3,	-- address 64bit words, not bytes
			G_PORTB_DWIDTH => C_BUS_BURST_DWIDTH,
                        G_PORTB_USE_BE => 0                     -- do not use byte enables
		)
		port map (
			addra => task2burst_Addr,
			addrb => i_burstAddr(0 to C_BUS_BURST_AWIDTH-1 -3),		-- RAM is addressing 64Bit values
			clka => task2burst_Clk,
			clkb => clk,
			dina => task2burst_Data,
			dinb => i_burstData,
			douta => burst2task_Data,
			doutb => o_burstData,
			wea => task2burst_WE,
			web => i_burstWE,
                        beb => '0'
		);

Note that the address widths of the ports correspond to the data widths, i.e.
the OSIF-side port B, which can transfer 64 bits of data per clock, also
addresses 64-bit words, _not_ _bytes_! That's why we subtract 3 from the
C_BUS_BURST_AWIDTH, which refers to byte-addressability.
