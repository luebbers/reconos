*
* The Xilinx interrupt controller driver component. This component supports the
* Xilinx interrupt controller.
*
* The interrupt controller driver uses the idea of priority for the various
* handlers. Priority is an integer within the range of 0 and 31 inclusive with
* 0 being the highest priority interrupt source.
*
* The Xilinx interrupt controller supports the following features:
*
*   - specific individual interrupt enabling/disabling
*   - specific individual interrupt acknowledging
*   - attaching specific callback function to handle interrupt source
*   - master enable/disable
*   - single callback per interrupt or all pending interrupts handled for
*     each interrupt of the processor
*
* The acknowledgement of the interrupt within the interrupt controller is
* selectable, either prior to the device's handler being called or after
* the handler is called. This is necessary to support interrupt signal inputs
* which are either edge or level signals.  Edge driven interrupt signals
* require that the interrupt is acknowledged prior to the interrupt being
* serviced in order to prevent the loss of interrupts which are occurring
* extremely close together.  A level driven interrupt input signal requires
* the interrupt to acknowledged after servicing the interrupt to ensure that
* the interrupt only generates a single interrupt condition.
*
* Details about connecting the interrupt handler of the driver are contained
* in the source file specific to interrupt processing, xintc_intr.c.
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works with
* physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads
* or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be
* satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*
* <b>Interrupt Vector Tables</b>
*
* The interrupt vector table for each interrupt controller device is declared
* statically in xintc_g.c within the configuration data for each instance.
* The device ID of the interrupt controller device is used by the driver as a
* direct index into the configuration data table - to retrieve the vector table
* for an instance of the interrupt controller. The user should populate the
* vector table with handlers and callbacks at run-time using the XIntc_Connect()
* and XIntc_Disconnect() functions.
*
* Each vector table entry corresponds to a device that can generate an
* interrupt. Each entry contains an interrupt handler function and an argument
* to be passed to the handler when an interrupt occurs.  The tools default this
* argument to the base address of the interrupting device.  Note that the
* device driver interrupt handlers given in this file do not take a base
* address as an argument, but instead take a pointer to the driver instance.
* This means that although the table is created statically, the user must still
* use XIntc_Connect() when the interrupt handler takes an argument other than
* the base address. This is only to say that the existence of the static vector
* tables should not mislead the user into thinking they no longer need to
* register/connect interrupt handlers with this driver.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -------------------------------------------------------
* 1.00a ecm  08/16/01 First release
* 1.00a rpm  01/09/02 Removed the AckLocation argument from XIntc_Connect().
*                     This information is now internal in xintc_g.c.
* 1.00b jhl  02/13/02 Repartitioned the driver for smaller files
* 1.00b jhl  04/24/02 Made LookupConfig function global and relocated config
*                     data type
* 1.00c rpm  10/17/03 New release. Support the static vector table created
*                     in the xintc_g.c configuration table. Moved vector
*                     table and options out of instance structure and into
*                     the configuration table.
* 1.10c mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style
* </pre>
